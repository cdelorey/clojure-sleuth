Assemble:
---------
* The suspects have all gathered here in the *room* to hear your accusation. The door is now locked
  * accuse
    * correct guest and room -> *murderer* turns to you in a state of shock. "How did you come to suspect me!
      sure I killed *victim*, and right here in this room. Though how you managed to figure it out,
      I'll never know"
      The case is closed after num_moves moves. You now rank as a professional sleuth.
    * incorrect guest and room -> very slipshod of you inspector. *murderer* murdered *victim* and the
      murder was commited in the *murder room* not the *current room*.
    * incorrect guest, correct room -> *murderer* rises and declares angrily, "You're wrong!! You've got
      the right room, but I was the one who used the *weapon* to kill *victim*"
    * correct guest, incorrect room -> *murderer* stands up and exclaims, "You fool! Yes, I used the
       *weapon* to get rid of *victim*. But I did it in the *murder room* not here in the *current_room*"
  * guestlist -> You must ACCUSE one of the six people in the room: + guestlist
  * quit/restart may work as usual
  * any other command -> Everyone is waiting with baited breath to hear your accusation!
* do you want to quit or restart? can't move/ do anything else

add randomness to staring at floor:
-----------------------------------
* Currently, there is a world flag for all guests to begin staring at the
  floor. To change it so that not all guests stare at the floor at once,
  the flag will have to be moved to the guest structure and flipped at
  random.
* in the sleuth update function, add a random chance to flip one or more
  guests' staring-at-floor flag. In the guest description function, check
  this flag, not the global flag to determine which description to display.
* the chance to make guests stare at the floor should be proportional to
  the number of turns that have passed.

* This needs to be checked only the first time the player enters the room to
  avoid the situation where a guest could start or stop staring at the floor
  while the player is in the room. But the entered room check is currently in
  the player move function! this would be an awkward place to start checking if
  changes need to be made to staring flags. It is also currently being used to check
  if the player has been cornered by the murderer upon entering the room.
  This is probably not the best place for this. How should this be changed? Set an
  external flag? Wouldn't want to check an external flag every turn to see if a room
  has been entered, but is there a better way to do this? The player move function
  and the input function that calls it, are the only places that have access to the
  previous and current location information necessary for the has-entered-room?
  function.
    * the player-move function is doing too many things!  refactor:
        1. function that deals only with player movement
        2. function that checks for player being cornered by murderer
        3. function that flips a random guest staring flag if necessary
        5. renamed player-move function that calls above functions

* Guest movement will also be checked in the new player-move function. These checks really should be
made in the update function; the player-move function ideally would not be doing so many things.
But the alternative would be either setting up some sort of message passing, which seems like
overkill in a project of this size, or setting an entered room flag that the update function checks.
* Maybe the player-move function will just check if a room has been entered using the current
and previous location information, and if so, set an entered room flag. The update function will
check for this flag, if it's true, it will call the functions for dealing with events that happen
only when a room is entered, and then unset the flag. This way, the move function doesn't have to
unset the flag. Is this a good organization? Are these flags too much like global state? It's
probably better than having update functionality in the player-move functions.
* the random stare flag flipping doesn't work very well. Maybe try flipping the flag of the guest
in the current room with a probability proportional to turn count?

* These functions can't go in update because they will not be invoked until after the player
has already entered the room. Whoops. Moving them back to player-move code for now.
