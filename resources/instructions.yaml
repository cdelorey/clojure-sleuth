As you begin a game of SLEUTH a murder has just been committed.\newline

Your job is  to mingle  with the houseguests and  to search the\newline

contents of the house until you feel you have solved the crime.\newline

Every game of SLEUTH is different so you must fully explore the\newline

house each time that you play.\newline\newline


You can  move through  the house by using the four  cursor keys\newline

located   on  the  numeric  keypad.   Be  particularly  careful\newline

when mocing  on the stairways  since you must change  direction\newline

each time you move from one floor to another\newline\newline


You can  search  rooms, people  and  objects  by  using  simple\newline

phrases such as EXAMINE DOOR, SEARCH VICTORIA, or  LOOK AT JAR.\newline

When  you want to  SEARCH or ACCUSE  a person you  only need to\newline

type in  their  first name.  To get more  information from  the\newline

guests you may  QUESTION  them, or ask  for their  ALIBIs.  The\newline

characters  tend to be rather moody and will  not always answer\newline

your  questions  the first time  around.  They are also  rather\newline

restless and will be  moving around the house  during the game.",



" The murder weapon will  be obvious as soon as you  EXAMINE the\newline

correct object.  (Though you will  need to find  the maginfying\newline

glass before you can  really conduct an  adequate search of the\newline

various  objects.)  You probably  should not GET  the weapon at\newline

first since the murderer is likely to become nervous if you are\newline

carrying  the evidence  around with  you.  If you  accidentally\newline

pick up  the object  at too early a point  in the game, you can\newline

DROP the weapon.  But be  forewarned!  Once dropped there is no\newline

telling where the object might end up!\newline\newline


Finding the scene of the murder  tends to be somewhat difficult\newline

since it is rarely possible to examine  every inch of the house\newline

with  your magnifying  glass.  Fortunately for  you, one of the\newline

keen-eyed guests  will probably notice  something amiss at some\newline

point during the game. To discover the murder room you must pay\newline

close attention to the behavior of the guests!\newline\newline


The murderer will be the one person whose ALIBI contradicts the\newline

alibis given  by the other houseguests.  Be  sure to keep track\newline

of everyone's story\newline",


" Once you have discovered both the murderer  and the murder room\newline

you  should  hurry  back to  GET  the  murder  weapon, and then\newline

move as  quickly as  possible to the  murder room,  GATHER  the\newline

suspects  together, and  ACCUSE  whoever you believe  to be the\newline

guilty  party.   But  be  careful!   The  murderer  is  a  very\newline

suspicious  sort and  may decide  to get rid of  you before you\newline

have a chance to make any accusations!\newline\newline


Most of the strategy involved in playing  SLEUTH  you will have\newline

to learn by playing the game.  Since  the  game  changes  every\newline

time  that  you  play  you  should be sure to fully explore the\newline

house.  Don't forget to explore  the room ehich has no  obvious\newline

entrances since  the murderer often discards  the murder weapon\newline

here.  Also, the murder is occasionally committed in this room.\newline

The  occupants  will be moving  about the house  throughout the\newline

game.  If you become confused at any time about who is actually\newline

in the house, you can request a GUEST LIST.\newline\newline


As your investigation proceeds the murderer  will begin to grow\newline

suspicious and  will most likely  start  plottting your demise.\newline

If you have not figured out who the  murderer is by this  point\newline

in the game, your chances of survival are slim. Be careful!\newline",



" To make things a little  more interesting, you can populate the\newline

house  with  people  that  you  already know.  Just select the\newline

Personalized  option  at  the  beginning  of the  game and the\newline

computer  will prompt you  for the names of  seven people (six\newline

suspects and on victim!).\newline\newline


SLEUTH  uses a fairly limited  vocabulary, so only  one or  two\newline

worlds should be  necessary to communicate  your intentions. If\newline

you like, you can abbreviate  QUESTION  as  Q  and  EXAMINE  as\newline

EX.  If  you are having difficulties, you can get a summary  of\newline

these instructions by typing HELP. You may also QUIT or RESTART\newline

at  any  time  during  the  game.  When  you  exit  from  these \newline

instructions you should be all set to enter the world of SLEUTH.\newline

Good luck!\newline\newline


P.S.  You  cannot  use  the  four  cursor  keys  while  you are\newline

typing in other information.  To clear  the message line on the\newline

bottom of the screen simply use the  backspace key or  the  ESC\newline

key.\newline"
