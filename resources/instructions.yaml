As you begin a game of SLEUTH a murder has just been committed.

Your job is  to mingle  with the houseguests and  to search the

contents of the house until you feel you have solved the crime.

Every game of SLEUTH is different so you must fully explore the

house each time that you play.


You can  move through  the house by using the four  cursor keys

located   on  the  numeric  keypad.   Be  particularly  careful

when mocing  on the stairways  since you must change  direction

each time you move from one floor to another


You can  search  rooms, people  and  objects  by  using  simple

phrases such as EXAMINE DOOR, SEARCH VICTORIA, or  LOOK AT JAR.

When  you want to  SEARCH or ACCUSE  a person you  only need to

type in  their  first name.  To get more  information from  the

guests you may  QUESTION  them, or ask  for their  ALIBIs.  The

characters  tend to be rather moody and will  not always answer

your  questions  the first time  around.  They are also  rather

restless and will be  moving around the house  during the game.",



" The murder weapon will  be obvious as soon as you  EXAMINE the

correct object.  (Though you will  need to find  the maginfying

glass before you can  really conduct an  adequate search of the

various  objects.)  You probably  should not GET  the weapon at

first since the murderer is likely to become nervous if you are

carrying  the evidence  around with  you.  If you  accidentally

pick up  the object  at too early a point  in the game, you can

DROP the weapon.  But be  forewarned!  Once dropped there is no

telling where the object might end up!


Finding the scene of the murder  tends to be somewhat difficult

since it is rarely possible to examine  every inch of the house

with  your magnifying  glass.  Fortunately for  you, one of the

keen-eyed guests  will probably notice  something amiss at some

point during the game. To discover the murder room you must pay

close attention to the behavior of the guests!


The murderer will be the one person whose ALIBI contradicts the

alibis given  by the other houseguests.  Be  sure to keep track

of everyone's story",


" Once you have discovered both the murderer  and the murder room

you  should  hurry  back to  GET  the  murder  weapon, and then

move as  quickly as  possible to the  murder room,  GATHER  the

suspects  together, and  ACCUSE  whoever you believe  to be the

guilty  party.   But  be  careful!   The  murderer  is  a  very

suspicious  sort and  may decide  to get rid of  you before you

have a chance to make any accusations!


Most of the strategy involved in playing  SLEUTH  you will have

to learn by playing the game.  Since  the  game  changes  every

time  that  you  play  you  should be sure to fully explore the

house.  Don't forget to explore  the room ehich has no  obvious

entrances since  the murderer often discards  the murder weapon

here.  Also, the murder is occasionally committed in this room.

The  occupants  will be moving  about the house  throughout the

game.  If you become confused at any time about who is actually

in the house, you can request a GUEST LIST.


As your investigation proceeds the murderer  will begin to grow

suspicious and  will most likely  start  plottting your demise.

If you have not figured out who the  murderer is by this  point

in the game, your chances of survival are slim. Be careful!",



" To make things a little  more interesting, you can populate the

house  with  people  that  you  already know.  Just select the

Personalized  option  at  the  beginning  of the  game and the

computer  will prompt you  for the names of  seven people (six

suspects and on victim!).


SLEUTH  uses a fairly limited  vocabulary, so only  one or  two

worlds should be  necessary to communicate  your intentions. If

you like, you can abbreviate  QUESTION  as  Q  and  EXAMINE  as

EX.  If  you are having difficulties, you can get a summary  of

these instructions by typing HELP. You may also QUIT or RESTART

at  any  time  during  the  game.  When  you  exit  from  these 

instructions you should be all set to enter the world of SLEUTH.

Good luck!


P.S.  You  cannot  use  the  four  cursor  keys  while  you are

typing in other information.  To clear  the message line on the

bottom of the screen simply use the  backspace key or  the  ESC

key."
