(defn make-fnmap
  "Make a function map out of the given sequence of fnspecs.

  A function map is a map of functions that you'd pass to extend. For 
  example, this sequence of fnspecs:

  ((foo [a] (println a)
   (bar [a b] (+ a b)))

  Would be turned into this fnmap:

  {:foo (fn [a] (println a))
   :bar (fn [a b] (+ a b))}

(defn make-fnheads
  "Make a sequence of fnheads of the given sequence of fnspecs.

  A fnhead is a sequence of (name args) like you'd pass to defprotocol.
  For example, this sequence of fnspecs:

  ((foo [a] (println a))
   (bar [a b] (+ a b)))

  Would be turned into this sequence of fnheads:

  ((foo [a])
   (bar [a b]))

(defmacro defaspect
  "Define an aspect with the given functions and default implementations.

  For example:

  (defaspect Fooable
    (foo [this world]
      (println \"Foo!\"))
    (can-foo? [this world]
      (contains? world :foo)))

  This will define a clojure protocol Fooable with the given functions as
  usual. It will also attach the function implementations as metadata,
  which is used by the add-aspect macro. Aside from the metadata, Fooable
  is a normal clojure protocol.

(defmacro add-aspect
  "Add an aspect to an entity type.

  This is similar to extend-type, with two differences:

  * It must be used on a protocol defined with defaspect
  * It will use the aspect's default function implementation for any
    functions not given.

  This allows us to define common aspect functions (like can-move? and
  move for Mobile) once and only once, while still allowing them to be
  overriden to customize behavior.

  For example:

  (add-aspect Fooer Fooable
    (foo [this world]
      (println \"Bar!\")))

  This will extend the type Fooer to implement the Fooable protocol. It
  will use the default implementation of can-foo? that was defined in 
  the addaspect call, but overrides the implementation of foo to do 
  something special.
